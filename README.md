***Abstract.***
*Obtaining accurate diagnosis in Dentistry has always been a challenge for professionals, especially those who have just started their careers. The knowledge required to get to a correct diagnosis, coupled with the variety of lesions with similar clinical and radiographic findings, led to the creation of systems for clinical decision support, called Expert Systems. In this work we presented an expert system to aid the process of diagnosing benign radiolucent lesions, that integrates a database based on radiographic features and a user-friendly web interface.*
